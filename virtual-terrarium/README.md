## 🎮 Quick Start

## ✨ 20 Full Features

### 1. 🌅 Dynamic Day/Night Cycle
The terrarium experiences a full 24-hour day/night cycle that affects creature behavior, plant growth, and the overall atmosphere. Watch as the lighting changes from dawn to dusk, with creatures becoming more or less active based on the time of day. Nocturnal sounds emerge after sunset, creating an immersive experience.

**Why it's meaningful**: Just like in nature, time of day drastically affects ecosystem behavior. Creatures have circadian rhythms that make them hunt, rest, or hide based on light levels.

### 2. ⛅ Advanced Weather System
Experience four distinct weather patterns (sunny, rainy, foggy, stormy) that dynamically affect your ecosystem. Rain increases soil moisture and humidity, helping plants but potentially drowning some creatures. Fog creates mystical conditions with high humidity, while storms bring dramatic environmental changes.

**Why it's meaningful**: Weather isn't just visual - it creates a cascading chain of effects through temperature changes, water availability, and creature behavior patterns.

### 3. 🦋 Multiple Creature Types with AI
Six different creature types (beetles, butterflies, spiders, ants, ladybugs, worms) each with unique behaviors, speeds, and ecological roles. Each creature has its own AI state machine that governs hunting, fleeing, resting, and wandering behaviors.

**Why it's meaningful**: Biodiversity is key to ecosystem stability. Each species fills a niche and creates dynamic interactions.

### 4. 🌱 Plant Growth System
Four plant varieties (grass, ferns, moss, flowers) that grow over time based on soil nutrients, moisture levels, and temperature. Plants can thrive or wither depending on environmental conditions, creating a realistic growth cycle.

**Why it's meaningful**: Plants are the foundation of the food web. Their health directly impacts herbivore populations, which in turn affects carnivores.

### 5. 🕸️ Ecosystem Balance & Predator-Prey Dynamics
A fully functional food web where herbivores eat plants, carnivores hunt herbivores, and decomposers break down dead matter. Population dynamics self-regulate through predator-prey relationships.

**Why it's meaningful**: This creates emergent gameplay where your actions have ripple effects. Add too many predators, and herbivores disappear. Over-plant, and the ecosystem becomes unbalanced.

### 6. 🌡️ Temperature & Humidity System
Environmental factors that change with weather and seasons, affecting creature survival and plant health. Extreme temperatures stress organisms, while optimal conditions promote thriving populations.

**Why it's meaningful**: Creates realistic survival challenges. You must maintain balanced conditions or watch species die off.

### 7. 🔊 Dynamic Sound Ecosystem
Procedurally generated ambient sounds that change based on time of day, weather conditions, and creature populations. Hear cricket chirps at night, rain patter during storms, and creature calls based on what's alive in your terrarium.

**Why it's meaningful**: Sound adds immersion and provides audio feedback about your ecosystem's health without looking at stats.

### 8. ♻️ Decomposition Cycle
Dead plants and creatures don't just disappear - they become organic matter that decomposers break down, returning nutrients to the soil. This creates a complete nutrient cycle.

**Why it's meaningful**: Teaches the importance of decomposition in nature. Without decomposers, nutrients get locked up and the ecosystem collapses.

### 9. 📊 Food Web Visualization
Real-time visual representation of the energy flow through your ecosystem, showing the relationships between producers (plants), herbivores, carnivores, and decomposers.

**Why it's meaningful**: Makes abstract ecological concepts visible and understandable. You can see at a glance if your food web is balanced.

### 10. 🧬 Creature Genetics System
Creatures can breed, passing genetic traits to offspring with slight mutations. Genetics affect speed, size, fertility, and lifespan. Over time, populations can evolve to better suit their environment.

**Why it's meaningful**: Introduces evolution and natural selection. Fast creatures might thrive in certain conditions, while larger ones survive in others.

### 11. 🍂 Seasonal Changes
Four distinct seasons (spring, summer, fall, winter) that cycle every 30 in-game days, each affecting temperature, humidity, and ecosystem behavior differently.

**Why it's meaningful**: Seasons create long-term planning challenges. Populations that thrive in summer might struggle in winter.

### 12. 🪨 Soil Quality System
Track soil nutrients, moisture, pH levels, and organic matter content. Plants deplete nutrients, while decomposition replenishes them. Moisture evaporates based on temperature.

**Why it's meaningful**: Soil is the foundation of terrestrial ecosystems. Poor soil = struggling plants = ecosystem collapse.

### 13. 💧 Water Cycle Simulation
Complete water cycle with evaporation, condensation, and precipitation. Ground water feeds into soil moisture, which evaporates based on temperature, eventually contributing to weather patterns.

**Why it's meaningful**: Shows the interconnectedness of Earth's systems. Your actions affect the water cycle, which affects everything else.

### 14. 🦠 Microbiome System
Invisible bacteria and fungi populations that affect decomposition rates and soil health. The microbiome thrives under optimal temperature and moisture conditions.

**Why it's meaningful**: Highlights the importance of microscopic life. Healthy microbiomes = efficient nutrient cycling = thriving ecosystem.

### 15. 🎭 Creature Personalities
Each creature has unique personality traits (aggression, curiosity, sociability, caution) that affect their behavior. Curious creatures explore more, while cautious ones flee from threats.

**Why it's meaningful**: Makes each creature feel unique and alive. You'll notice different behaviors even within the same species.

### 16. 🏆 Achievement System
Seven achievements to unlock by reaching milestones like ecosystem balance, population booms, successful breeding, and experiencing all weather types.

**Why it's meaningful**: Provides goals and rewards for good ecosystem management, encouraging experimentation.

### 17. 📈 Ecosystem Health Score
Real-time calculation based on biodiversity, population balance, environmental conditions, and organism health. Score between 0-100%.

**Why it's meaningful**: Gives immediate feedback on your management decisions. High scores require balancing multiple factors.

### 18. ⏱️ Time Manipulation
Control time flow with pause, normal (1x), fast (5x), and ultra-fast (10x) speeds. Watch your ecosystem evolve over days in minutes.

**Why it's meaningful**: Lets you observe long-term patterns and evolution without waiting hours. Essential for experimental gameplay.

### 19. 📹 Camera System
Zoom in/out, pan around, reset view, and follow individual creatures as they move through the terrarium. Get close-up views of the action.

**Why it's meaningful**: Makes the ecosystem feel vast and detailed. Following a single creature tells a personal survival story.

### 20. 🎬 Time-lapse Recording
Record your ecosystem's evolution frame-by-frame and export time-lapse sequences showing days of growth and change.

**Why it's meaningful**: Capture and share your unique ecosystem's story. See patterns that emerge over time.
